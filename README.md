Swift Safe Store is a safety utility that helps protect your passwords, credit card details and documents by using encryption.

Account Safety:
To ensure highest security, the following requirements apply to your account login details:
Your username must be between 5 and 30 characters and must not already be initialized in the system. We urge you to provide a strong password for your account. For your security, we incorporated these requirements for the password and answer to the security question. Your password and security answer must be between 8 and 25 characters, and contain:
 - one capital letter
 - one lowercase letter
 - one special character
 - one number.
Your security question must be between 10 and 30 characters.

	Failure to provide the correct password in more than 3 attemps results in Account Blockage. 
		
	Do not panic if this happens to you! Your files are safe and sound!

Account Blockage simply means that you must change your account password using the answer to your security question. That is why it is highly important that the answer to the security question is different than your password. Try your best to always remember your password or security answer.
